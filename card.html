			<p>Powerful and fast-flying, the Peregrine Falcon hunts medium-sized birds, dropping down 
			on them from high above in a spectacular stoop. They were virtually eradicated from eastern 
			North America by pesticide poisoning in the middle 20th century. After significant recovery 
			efforts, Peregrine Falcons have made an incredible rebound and are now regularly seen in many 
			large cities and coastal areas.</p>
